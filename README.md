# weather-app

This app uses openweather API to fetch latest weather updates.
It can entertain two cities (Serbia and Belgrade). Cities can be swapped through a drop down at top.

You can switch to online and offline mode through a switch. If its offline then data would be fetched from raw files. 
In online it would be fetched freshly from API.

Pull to refresh functionality also is there but that is dependent on switch, if switch is turned on, it would update from API else from local json file.
